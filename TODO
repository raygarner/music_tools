IMPORTANT: use is_correct_accidental key to use correct symbols
find another way to fix edge cases in is_correct_accidental other than hardcoding
integrate unix program to randomise the order of its args
	this is to switch up output from crd
	shows integration with general unix tools
VOICE GENERATOR
	can take a list of notes (eg output from crd) and generate a second voice to be played at the same time
	this way we can evaluate chord transition frequency (chords can be implied with just 2 voices) and also melody interval frequency
	parallel 3rds = good
	parallel 5ths = bad
	contrary motion = good
	root inversion = good
	first inversion = good
	second inversion = bad
use - to specify reading from STDIN, not the other way round
write program to take unsorted musical data such as modes or chords and return it as a list sorted by 'tension' value of each item
add index/id to each line of output so can track data flow
