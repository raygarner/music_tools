make hrm harmonise a list of melodies

hrm:
	take output from mld and add bass line
	2 voice harmony
	chord transisions should match bach analysis
	standard rules:
		parallel 3rds = good
		parallel 5ths = bad
		contrary motion = good
		root inversion = good
		first inversion = good
		second inversion = bad
	just chords I, IV, V using root and first inversion
musicxml output format
make en ionian use 4 sharps (not a weird mix of sharps and flats)
	En F+ A- An Bn C+ E- - En Ionian
add argument specifying beats between chord tones in ml
idea: crd can take decimals
	eg 1010100 for triad
	but think 2010100 to double the root eg C E G C chord
	eg crd 2010100 would return C E G C
note: g- locrian - is invalid

generalise step() so it can go up or down
find another way to fix edge cases in is_correct_accidental other than hardcoding

write program to take unsorted musical data such as modes or chords and return it as a list sorted by 'tension' value of each item
add index/id to each line of output so can track data flow
hard code degree vals
make int allow user to specify which notes are natural 
flag to input notes via stdin for md
shorten lines over 79 chars wide
program to identify chords
