create makefile
link various ideas together
let md work on a limited amount of modes
	think of it like this: it currently takes input but the input is just
	the list of all the possible modes
	if it reads any input then it will only operate on those modes specified
	otherwise use all modes like normal
create interval program
	similar to md, prints a list of modes
	takes intervals eg major third, minor sixth as args and prints all modes
	with meet those requirements
	like md it can take input specifying which modes to consider otherwise
	it just considers all
allow chord program to work with other systems
use fb as ui end point to pipe data into to display it
use cf as ui end point to pipe data to to display it
create makefile
create git repo
write program to take unsorted musical data such as modes or chords and return
it as a list sorted by 'tension' value of each item
put common functions in .h file and include in each of the programs
add index/id to each line of output so can track data flow
dont use a key matrix for crd just print output while reading
	write common function to read one key to make this easy
